# Face-Mask-Detector
Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and TensroflowJS on client side.

- Trained face mask detecction Model in Keras Tensorflow ( Python ) and then converted that model to a form that can be used by Tensorflow JS.
- Used OpenCV (haarcascade) to detect faces in JS and then used TensorflowJS for predicting the masks on faces.
- Everything is happening on client side.

- Starter Project to use ML/DL in browsers on client side.
